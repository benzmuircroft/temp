# üï≥Ô∏èü•äüåê **@ypear/router**


## üíæ Installation
```bash
npm install @ypear/router
```

## üëÄ Description
A router runs a single Hyperswarm. It routes topics. It is modular and can support a single @ypear/userbase, multiple @ypear/database's and multiple @ypear/crdt's. This is faster than creating a new Hyperswarm in each module!


## üß∞ Methods
```javascript
{
    swarm,
    start,
    get started() { return started; }, // singular for the router
    alow,                              // enable multi event path
    deny,                              // dissable ^^^
    isYpearRouter: true,
    publicKey: options.publicKey,
    destroy: () => {                   // kill underlying streams
      swarm.destroy();
      peers = {};
    },
    get options() { return options; }, // Expose options for other modules to access
    updateOptions: (obj) => {          // used by userbase
      options = { ...obj, ...options }
    },
    updateOptionsCache: (obj) => {     // used by databse and crdt
      if (!options.cache) options.cache = {};
      options.cache = { ...obj, ...options.cache }
    },
    peers,
    tag,
    //
    // todo: wtf is the difference vvv !!?
    //
    broadcast // maybe used by userbase
  };
```

## ‚úÖ Usage
See usage with @ypear/userbase instead.
```javascript
// Initialize without userbase
const router = await ypearRouter({}, {
  seed: '32 hex string', // unpacks to a determinilistic keyPair (you can get this after userbase.login)
  username: 'bob' // make up a name or got on userbase.login
});

await router.start('topic');

const [
  propagate, // wait till everyone propagates to everyone and replys done 
  broadcast, // same as propagate but no waiting for replys (noone replys)
  toPeers, // max 56 peers (noone replys)
  toPeer // to one peer (does not reply)
] = await router.alow(options.topic, async function handler(d) {
  // messages from other peers on this topic come through here
});

// Send data
await propagate(dataObject);

await broadcast(dataObject);

await toPeers(dataObject);

await toPeer(publicKey, dataObject);
```
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Misusage
todo.

## ü§Ø Gotchas
- The userbase takes a router that has not been started

- If the router has a userbase; the router will replicate the userbase's corestore

- Propagate will send to each of your 64 which makes them propagate to there 64 and so-on and so-on but each person that receives it is tagged in the message and will not respond a second time by a hit from another peer. Each will wait until there entire group has responded/dropped-out/timesout to reply and this will cascade back to you like a sonar mapping a room

- Each database or crdt must be on it's own unique topic. You can use it without userbase, but, you will need to start it with seed and username on your own (think of this as 'unprovable-mode')

- Each crdt/database added to the router, alter the routers opions.cache, therefore adding themselves to the router as topics

- A database automatically runs a crdt side-by-side under the hood; so each database will alter the routers options.cache twice ('databaseTopic' = database and 'databaseTopic-db' = crdt)

- Using `alow` achually lets you alow sub topics (so you can use it for many unique things) and can be used along side `deny`. In-other-words; you arn't forced to alow the topic that you `start`ed the router with
